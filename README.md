# [Capt'n Boilerplate]

Capt'n Boilerplate is a front-end template using a collection of code created or fetched here and there over the time and mixed together. AWD grid system, LESS powered, Grunt ready and built with ease in mind. Nothing fancy. This is what I use at work, adapted to my workflow. Don't hesitate to break it and adapt it to your own style.
